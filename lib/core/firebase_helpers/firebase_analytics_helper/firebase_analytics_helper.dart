// Analytics automatically logs some events for you; you don't need to add any code to receive them.
// If your app needs to collect additional data, you can log up to 500 different Analytics Event types in your app.
// There is no limit on the total volume of events your app logs.
// Note that event names are case-sensitive and that logging two events whose names differ only in
// case will result in two distinct events.

  // Generally, events logged by your app are batched together over the period of approximately one
  // hour and uploaded together. This approach conserves the battery on end usersâ€™ devices and reduces
  // network data usage. However, for the purposes of validating your Analytics implementation (and,
  // in order to view your Analytics in the DebugView report), you can enable debug mode on your
  // development device to upload events with a minimal delay.

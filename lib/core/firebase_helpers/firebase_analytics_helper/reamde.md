#READ THIS!:

Debug events

DebugView enables you to see the raw event data logged by your app on development devices in near real-time.
This is very useful for validation purposes during the instrumentation phase of development and can help you
discover errors and mistakes in your Analytics implementation and confirm that all events and user properties are logged correctly.



Enable debug mode

Generally, events logged by your app are batched together over the period of approximately one hour and uploaded together.
This approach conserves the battery on end usersâ€™ devices and reduces network data usage. However,
for the purposes of validating your Analytics implementation (and, in order to view your Analytics in the DebugView report),
you can enable debug mode on your development device to upload events with a minimal delay.
